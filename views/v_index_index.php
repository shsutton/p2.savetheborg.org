<p>“Since, in the long run, every planetary civilization will be endangered by impacts from space,
 every surviving civilization is obliged to become spacefaring--not because of exploratory or romantic
 zeal, but for the most practical reason imaginable: staying alive... If our long-term survival is at stake, 
 we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds.” <br>
― Carl Sagan</p>

<p>“We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy,
 but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies
 and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, 
 and one which we intend to win.” <br>
― John F. Kennedy</p>

<p>"So, like, if you and your girlfriend are having a fight in space, and you decide to break up with her, 
do you tell her that you just need some 'space space'?<br>
-Stuart H. Sutton</p><br>
